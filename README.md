Monty Bytecode Interpreter
Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter project! Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. This efficient and user-friendly interpreter is designed to read Monty bytecode files and execute them on a custom-built virtual machine. Dive into the world of stack-based programming with ease.
This project is a collaboration of two members of Cohort 18 ALX SE: Anns Rutto and Davis Koech.
Features:
Lightweight and Fast: Optimized for quick interpretation.
User-Friendly: Clear error messages and straightforward usage.
Versatile: Handles a variety of Monty bytecode commands.
